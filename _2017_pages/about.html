      <p>We'll kick things off with a Calcutta. Each team is required to purchase 50% of their team for $200 ($50/player). The other 50% of the team will be auctioned off, for any bidder to purchase. 1st place team owners receives 90% of winnings, 2nd place team owners receive 10% of winnings, and will be distributed according to ownership percentage.</p>
      
      <p>The 4-man teams will play 3 separate 9-hole rounds (Scramble, Chapman, and Match Play), that will convert to team points for each: 1st place gets 5 team points, 2nd place gets 2 team points, 3rd place gets 0 team points, totaling 27 holes.</p>
