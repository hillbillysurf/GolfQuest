      <h2 class="first">Format</h2>

      <p>We'll kick things off with a Calcutta. Each team is required to purchase 50% of their team for $200 ($50/player). The other 50% of the team will be auctioned off, for any bidder to purchase. 1st place team owners receives 90% of winnings, 2nd place team owners receive 10% of winnings, and will be distributed according to ownership percentage. <a href='https://venmo.com/u/Hillbillysurf'>Venmo Johnny.</a></p>
      
      <p>The 4-man teams will play 3 separate 9-hole rounds (Scramble, Chapman, and Three Ball). Each round will distribute 3 team points, similar to the Three Ball points system. If there is a clear 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place, points will be 2, 1, and 0 team points, respectively. If there is a 1st place and Tie for 2nd place, it would be 2, 0.5, 0.5 points, respectively. In a 3-way tie, each team would receive 1 point.</p>
