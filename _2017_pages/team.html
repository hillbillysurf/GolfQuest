      <p>Keith's delayed flight caused a little shuffle on our agenda, but it all worked out in the end, with great weather and solid competition. We switched Scramble to the first round and Best Ball to the 3rd, and we got Evan as a sub and 9th explorer.</p>
      <p>After the Scramble and Chapman rounds, there were two clear leaders: Andrew/Keith/Evan and Josh/Garret. In the Best Ball round, they tied almost every hole until Josh/Garret clinched victory after winning #17.</p>
      <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
